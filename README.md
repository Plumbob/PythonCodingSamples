# PythonCodingSamples

Various Python scripts intended as a demonstration of my coding style.

Some of these are coding challenges from my interviews over the years, others are
simple "puzzle" excercises.

Required public libraries -- such as Flask -- are not included here.

None of these demonstrate optimal solutions nor production-ready code.
